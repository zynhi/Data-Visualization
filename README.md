# Obesity Data Visualization Project

This project was completed as a final assignment for the **Data Visualization** course at UEH University. We explored the impact of personal and lifestyle factors on obesity levels using Python, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques.

## ðŸ“Š Objective

- Identify key factors affecting obesity such as age, gender, dietary habits, physical activity, and family history.
- Clean and preprocess a real-world dataset from Kaggle.
- Perform statistical tests (ANOVA, Chi-Square) to assess significance.
- Visualize patterns and correlations using effective plots.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: [Obesity Levels | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels)

## ðŸ§© Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removed duplicates and outliers
   - Converted data types appropriately
   - Created BMI variable for enhanced analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Univariate analysis on numerical & categorical features
   - Correlation heatmaps and pairwise plots

3. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - ANOVA for continuous variables
   - Chi-Square tests for categorical variables
   - Identified statistically significant variables affecting obesity

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Bar charts, violin plots, scatter plots
   - Visualized obesity levels across different age, gender, activity, and dietary habits

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

- High BMI and weight strongly correlate with obesity.
- Variables such as age, vegetable consumption, water intake, and exercise frequency show significant impact.
- Lifestyle choices and family history are statistically linked with obesity risk.
